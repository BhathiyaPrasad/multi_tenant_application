## Overview

**multi_tenant_application** is a lightweight, scalable foundation for building multi-tenant applications. It provides robust tenant isolation, dynamic routing, and customizable configurations per tenant, making it ideal for SaaS platforms, internal tools, or any system requiring secure and efficient multi-client architecture.

## Features

- **Multi-Tenancy**: Each tenant has isolated data and routes, typically accessed via subdomains (e.g., `tenant1.bhathiya.me`).
- **Dynamic Tenant Creation**: Users can create their own tenant spaces via a simple form.
- **Secure Authentication**: User signup and login are tenant-specific, with JWT-based authentication and token management.
- **Customizable Dashboards**: Each tenant has a dedicated dashboard and content area.
- **Robust Data Handling**: Uses Prisma ORM and PostgreSQL for scalable backend management.
- **Content Management**: Tenants can create, read, update, and delete blog posts and comments.
- **Clean Architecture**: Built for maintainability with modern full-stack technologies.

## Main Components

### 1. Tenant Management

- **Create Tenant**: `src/app/create-tenant/page.tsx`  
  Users can register new tenants by entering a slug and name. On success, they're redirected to the signup page for their tenant subdomain.

- **Get Tenant from Urls**: `src/middleware.ts`  
  Utility to extract the tenant slug from Request Url, ensuring all operations are contextually tenant-aware.

- **Seed Data**: `prisma/seeds.ts`  
  Seeds initial tenants in the database for testing and demonstration.

### 2. Authentication

- **Signup & Login**:
    - `src/app/api/auth/signup/route.ts`: Handles user registration, creating a tenant if it doesn't exist.
    - `src/components/login-form.tsx`: Authenticates users, retrieves a token, and redirects to the tenant dashboard, setting a secure cookie.

- **Token Handling**:
    - `src/app/(tenant)/set-token/route.ts`: Manages redirecting users and setting JWT tokens as cookies after login.

### 3. Blog Functionality

- **CRUD APIs**:
    - `src/app/api/blogs/tenant/route.ts` & `src/app/api/blogs/tenant/[id]/route.ts`: APIs for tenant-specific blog creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion. All actions are protected and scoped to the authenticated user's tenant.
    - `src/app/api/public/blogs/route.ts`: Public API for retrieving blogs (with tenant and comments included).

### 4. Dashboard & UI

- **Tenant Dashboard**:
    - `src/app/(tenant)/dashboard/page.tsx`: Main dashboard for each tenant, leveraging reusable UI components.

- **Sidebar & Navigation**:
    - `src/components/app-sidebar.tsx`: Sidebar navigation for quick access to main features.

- **About Page**:
    - `src/app/about/page.tsx`: Describes the application's value proposition and architecture.

### 5. Core Architecture

- **Dynamic Routing**:  
  Next.js routing structure enables per-tenant subdomain handling and route isolation.
- **Prisma ORM**:  
  Data models for users, tenants, blogs, and comments are managed using Prisma and PostgreSQL.

## Example Workflow

1. **Create a Tenant**:  
   User fills out the tenant creation form. On success, they are redirected to their tenant-specific signup page.

2. **Signup/Login**:  
   User registers or logs in. A JWT token is issued and stored in a secure cookie.

3. **Access Dashboard**:  
   After authentication, users are redirected to their tenant dashboard, where they can manage content.

4. **Blog Management**:  
   Users can create, edit, and delete blog posts within their own tenant space.
